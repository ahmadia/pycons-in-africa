The big idea
============

To hold a PyCon (`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ conference) in an African
nation, aimed at:

* nurturing the skills of local software developers
* supporting and encouraging the formation of local open source development
  communities
* helping equip the host nation with a skillset that will enable it to build
  and maintain sustainable local IT infrastructures
* helping establish open source software as an obvious choice for African
  agencies and the foreign donor community

and to establish it as a sustainable annual event.
