==================
About the proposal
==================

This is the start of a first draft - please amend and add to it in whatever way
you think appropriate. I hope that I'll be able to present a proposal supported
by:

* Python/open source communities in Africa
* potential active participants from the Python community
* the wider Python community
* people and organisations already involved in similar initiatives
* the Welsh Government and other agencies
