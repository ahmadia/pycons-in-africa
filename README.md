# PyCons in Africa

> This is the start of a first draft - please amend and add to it in whatever way you think appropriate. I'll continue work on it myself. I hope that I'll be able to present a proposal supported by:

>   * the wider Python community
>   * potential active participants from the Python community
>   * people and organisations already involved in similar initiatives
>   * the Welsh Assembly Government and other agencies


## The big idea

To hold a PyCon (Python conference) in an African nation, aimed at:

* nurturing the skills of local software developers
* supporting and encouraging the formation of local open source development communities
* helping equip the host nation with a skillset that will enable it to build and maintain sustainable local IT infrastructures
* helping establish open source software as an obvious choice for African agencies and the foreign donor community

### Where in Africa

* sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa

### The conference format

This will be a technical conference, following the model of traditional [PyCons](http://www.pycon.org/) held around the world.

* talks
* workshops and tutorials
* code sprints
* the community

### Objectives

By the end of the conference:

* local people of all levels of skill, including developers, students and children
    * will have been introduced to new:
        * ideas
        * skills, techniques, knowledge
        * communities
    * will have been introduced to active participation in some of the world's largest open source software projects
    * will have formed communities and networks

## Why open source?

* the problem with closed projects, even as generous gifts
* the problem with closed languages and architectures
* sustainability
* cost

## Why Python?

* a modern language
* a teaching language
* PyCon and education
* the Python and PyCon culture and ethos

### Existing Python projects in Africa
