# PyCons in Africa

> This is the start of a first draft - please amend and add to it in whatever way you think appropriate. I hope that I'll be able to present a proposal supported by:

>   * Python/open source communities in Africa
>   * potential active participants from the Python community
>   * the wider Python community
>   * people and organisations already involved in similar initiatives
>   * the Welsh Government and other agencies


## The big idea

To hold a PyCon ([Python](http://www.python.org) conference) in an African nation, aimed at:

* nurturing the skills of local software developers
* supporting and encouraging the formation of local open source development communities
* helping equip the host nation with a skillset that will enable it to build and maintain sustainable local IT infrastructures
* helping establish open source software as an obvious choice for African agencies and the foreign donor community

### Where in Africa

* sub-Saharan Africa
* excluding South Africa, which has an active Python and open source software development community

### The conference format

This will be a technical conference, following the model of traditional [PyCons](http://www.pycon.org/) held around the world.

* talks
* workshops and tutorials
* code sprints
* the community

#### About PyCons

Most PyCons are local editions of the conference. [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org) in North America and [EuroPython](https://europython.eu) are very large international events; most others are considerably smaller and serve a more local community.

The vast majority of PyCon events rely on volunteers from the community. They are organised and managed by a local committee, with funding coming from ticket sales, sponsorship and support of organisations including the [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org/psf/).

A viable and sustainable PyCon in an African nation will need to be run largely on this basis. Support - technical, organisational or financial - may come from outside (as it usually does in any case), but the event will need to be owned by the local community.

### Objectives

> What else should be amongst the objectives of the event?

By the end of the conference:

* local people of all levels of skill, including developers, students and children
    * will have been introduced to new:
        * ideas
        * skills, techniques, knowledge
        * communities
    * will have been introduced to active participation in some of the world's largest open source software projects
    * will have formed communities and networks
* local decision-makers and procurement agencies will ...
* open source software and Python in particular will ...
* members of the international Python community will have established contact and formed connections with members of the local community

## Why open source?

> Any other reasons?

### The problem with closed systems

It's necessary for any IT system, particularly one with a long intended life-span, that it should be adaptable to future and changing needs, and able to keep pace with technological developments. If it isn't, it will soon become obsolete.

If developing, maintaining and adapting a system can only be achieved by its supplier, then its users are locked in - beholden - to the supplier.

This lock-in may matter less for wealthy users, but for those with fewer resources, such a future burden is hard to bear. Even if the system is a generous gift, it's a gift with a cost.

The world's least wealthy nations can least afford to invest in, or even accept gifts of, IT systems and infrastructure projects that lock them in.

Open source options provide a way for them to own and develop their own systems and projects, and to take charge of off-the-shelf systems that they adopt, or become participants in the wider communities that maintain them.

##### The problem with closed languages, architectures and environments...

The tools with which and the environments in which systems are created also matter. A closed platform can be used to develop an open source system, but its owners will still remain locked-in to the tools and the platform, and tied to their future.

Open source environments, languages and development frameworks make total ownership of software possible.

### Cost and sustainability

The comparatively low cost of open source systems lowers the bar to acquisition and participation.

If a developing nation is to develop the skillset required to create and maintain software that meets its own needs, it will need to educate and train its own software developers, equipping schools and universities with systems it can afford and can afford to maintain in the future.

Open source systems make it possible to create a virtuous circle of sustainable investment.

## Why Python?

> Any other reasons?

Python is a modern general-purpose language, used throughout the world in everything from embedded systems to large-scale infrastructures. Python is free open source software.

Python has its roots in education, and was conceived in part as a language for computer science teaching. These roots manifest themselves in the way it emphasises simplicity and clarity, making it a particularly easy language to learn and being using productively.

As well as being favoured in education, Python's connections with education have helped build around it a valuable ecosystem and culture that support new learners of the language.

Again partly through its roots in education, the Python culture and community are very welcoming of new learners, and informed by a genuine ethos of friendliness and mutual support. This ethos is exemplified in the behaviour of the worldwide Python community, for example in the very strong codes of conduct that are adopted by PyCons, and the tenor of online communication within it.

The Python community's spirit of generosity and its concerted engagement with questions of diversity within IT help make Python an especially appropriate choice for a conference of the kind proposed.
