# PyCons in Africa

> This is the start of a first draft - please amend and add to it in whatever way you think appropriate. I'll continue work on it myself. I hope that I'll be able to present a proposal supported by:

>   * Python/open source communities in Africa
>   * potential active participants from the Python community
>   * the wider Python community
>   * people and organisations already involved in similar initiatives
>   * the Welsh Assembly Government and other agencies


## The big idea

To hold a PyCon ([Python](http://www.python.org) conference) in an African nation, aimed at:

* nurturing the skills of local software developers
* supporting and encouraging the formation of local open source development communities
* helping equip the host nation with a skillset that will enable it to build and maintain sustainable local IT infrastructures
* helping establish open source software as an obvious choice for African agencies and the foreign donor community

### Where in Africa

* sub-Saharan Africa
* excluding South Africa, which has an active Python and open source software development community

### The conference format

This will be a technical conference, following the model of traditional [PyCons](http://www.pycon.org/) held around the world.

* talks
* workshops and tutorials
* code sprints
* the community

#### About PyCons

Most PyCons are local editions of the conference. [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org) in North America and [EuroPython](https://europython.eu) are very large international events; most others are considerably smaller and serve a more local community.

The vast majority of PyCon events rely on volunteers from the community. They are organised and managed by a local committee, with funding coming from ticket sales, sponsorship and support of organisations including the [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org/psf/).

A viable and sustainable PyCon in an African nation will need to be run largely on this basis. Support - technical, organisational or financial - may come from outside (as it usually does in any case), but the event will need to be owned by the local community.

### Objectives

By the end of the conference:

* local people of all levels of skill, including developers, students and children
    * will have been introduced to new:
        * ideas
        * skills, techniques, knowledge
        * communities
    * will have been introduced to active participation in some of the world's largest open source software projects
    * will have formed communities and networks
* local decision-makers and procurement agencies will ...
* open source software and Python in particular will ...
* members of the international Python community will have established contact and formed connections with members of the local community

## Why open source?

* the problem with closed projects, even as generous gifts...
* the problem with closed languages and architectures...
* sustainability...
* cost...

## Why Python?

* a modern language...
* a teaching language...
* PyCon and education...
* the Python and PyCon culture and ethos...

### Existing Python projects in Africa
